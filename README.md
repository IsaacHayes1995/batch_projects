## Overview

Meet BatchProjects, an open-source project management app for your team built natively for ERPNext.

Experience the freedom of managing your projects in a fast, modern, and collaborative interface while keeping all your financials, timesheets, and accounting inside ERPNext. No more exporting, no more manual syncing, and no more context switching between multiple tools.

## Open Core & Architecture

We believe in full transparency regarding how BatchProjects is built and licensed. We use an **Open Core** model so the open-source community gets a fully functional ERP project system while supporting sustainable ongoing development.

### What's included?

| Feature | Open Core (`AGPL-3.0`) | BP Gateway (`bp-gateway`) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Kanban Boards, Backlogs, Gantt & Sprints** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **ERPNext Document Linking (SO, PO, Timesheets)** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Custom Fields & Project Workflows** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Profitability & Utilization Reporting** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Real-time Multi-user WebSocket Sync** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Visual Automation Rule Builder** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Workflow Webhooks & Push Notifications** | ❌ | ✅ |

* **BatchProjects Core** is 100% free, AGPL-v3 licensed, and fully functional standalone.
* **bp-gateway** is an optional proprietary companion service available as a self-hostable Docker container. Installing it unlocks real-time sync, automations, all premium features. You can host it yourself for full control over your data and security.

## Use Cases

* **Construction & Engineering:** Tie task progress to Purchase Orders and subcontractor expenses for precise budget monitoring.
* **Manufacturing & Operations:** Manage delivery phases tied to ERPNext production schedules and procurement.
* **Software Development Teams:** Use Agile/Scrum or Waterfall workflows with real-time collaboration and automated reporting.
* **Professional Services:** Monitor project profitability, resource utilization, and automate client billing directly from ERPNext.
* **Education & Research:** Manage research projects, grant budgets, and academic collaborations with integrated financial tracking.

## Quick Start (Core App)

This branch runs as a standard Frappe app on **Frappe v16 / ERPNext v16**.
HRMS is optional; when it is installed, BatchProjects automatically enables
Expense Claim re-invoicing fields on the next migration.

```bash
# Navigate to your bench directory
cd ~/frappe-bench

# Get the app
bench get-app https://github.com/IsaacHayes1995/batch_projects --branch version-16

# Install on your site
bench --site your-site.local install-app batch_projects

# Run migrations
bench --site your-site.local migrate
```

That's the entire community version install — no Node, no build step, no external
service. The `version-16` branch tracks ERPNext v16; see
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for the full version-compatibility
story and how branch naming maps to ERPNext versions going forward.

For local frontend development, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Built with

[Frappe Framework](https://frappeframework.com) · [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com) · [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org) · [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) · Python

## The optional but recommended add-on

Realtime updates, automation rules, ERP integration, and other
premium features run through a small companion service (**bp-gateway**) that sits between frontend and backend of batch_projects app and handles heavy lifting required to handle premium features — it can run on same or dedicated server and provides you full control over your data and security.

If you only need the community version, skip this gateway entirely — BatchProjects runs standalone on community plan.

See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for the install guide.

## License

BatchProjects — the Frappe app and the Vue frontend, everything in this
repo — is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0**
(AGPL-3.0-only). See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

The practical implication of AGPL: if you modify this app and run it as a
network service for others (e.g. offer it as SaaS), you must make your
modified source available to those users. Just self-hosting it for your own
company, unmodified or modified, carries no such obligation beyond attribution.

The optional `bp-gateway` add-on is separate, proprietary addon,
distributed as a signed container image under its own license — using it is
optional and doesn't change the license of BatchProjects itself.

PRs welcome — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the branch model,
dev setup, and CI requirements. Security issues: see
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), please don't file those as public issues.
