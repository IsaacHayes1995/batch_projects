    Previously the entry had a fixed name ("index.js") with a manually
    appended ?v=<mtime> query for cache-busting. Rollup's own chunk-to-chunk
    imports back into the entry (which happen for any code shared between
    App.vue and a lazy-loaded route — routine, not a misconfiguration) always
    use the bare output filename, which never matched the query-stringed URL
    the HTML used. The browser treated those as two different modules and
    ran the entry's top-level side effects (app mount, bootstrapBridge,
    connectRealtime, every boot-time API call) a second time. Content-hashing
    the entry like every other chunk makes all references resolve to the
    same URL, so there's nothing left to mismatch.
