"""
batch_projects/gateway_guard.py
────────────────────────────────
Verifies that API requests to batch_projects came through the bp-gateway,
and — for cross-origin browser sessions — re-scopes the effective Frappe
user to whoever the gateway asserts, before any business logic runs.

The gateway signs every proxied request with an HMAC-SHA256 signature:
    X-BP-Gateway-Sig: hex(HMAC-SHA256(shared_secret,
        "bp-gw:" + ts + ":" + method + ":" + path + ":" + acting_user))
    X-BP-Gateway-Ts:          unix timestamp
    X-BP-Acting-User:         "" for same-origin (sid cookie) traffic; the
                               real user's email for cross-origin (bearer
                               JWT) traffic, ALWAYS included in the
                               signature input so it can't be stripped or
                               forged independently of it.

verify_gateway_request() (opt-in, called from selected whitelisted methods)
verifies the signature and rejects the request if it's missing/invalid —
closing the direct-to-Frappe bypass vector for those specific endpoints.

apply_gateway_identity() (wired globally as a before_request hook — see
hooks.py) is the identity handoff: cross-origin browsers can only reach
Frappe by riding on the gateway's service-account credential (Frappe has no
notion of the gateway's own JWTs), so without this hook every such request
would silently execute AS the service account — a real privilege escalation,
since that account holds System Manager rights. This hook re-scopes
frappe.session.user to the REAL asserted user immediately, so every
permission check downstream sees them, never the service account. It is a
no-op whenever X-BP-Gateway-Sig is absent (same-origin traffic, or anything
not proxied by the gateway) or when acting_user is empty (same-origin
sid-cookie traffic already has its own correct user).

Config (site_config.json):
    bp_gateway_shared_secret   — must EQUAL gateway's FRAPPE_SHARED_SECRET

Leave unset ⇒ both checks are skipped (dev without gateway enforcement) —
and, in that mode, apply_gateway_identity() never touches session.user.

IMPORTANT — always raise frappe.PermissionError here, NEVER
frappe.AuthenticationError: Frappe's own core exception handler
(frappe/app.py handle_exception) has a blanket rule — ANY AuthenticationError
raised ANYWHERE during a request, regardless of source, causes
login_manager.clear_cookies(), i.e. a REAL logout, as a side effect. These
two functions reject a specific REQUEST as improperly routed; they are not
asserting the user's actual login is invalid. Using AuthenticationError here
once meant every same-origin call to a gateway-guarded endpoint — which is
completely normal on a topology where Frappe's own domain isn't gateway-
fronted, e.g. this app's own SPA loads and fires a few calls before its
cross-origin bridge session finishes bootstrapping — silently logs the user
out: login succeeds, /app (desk) works, but /projects (this app's SPA)
logs the user straight back out, every time.
